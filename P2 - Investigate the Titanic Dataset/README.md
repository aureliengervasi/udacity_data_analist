#Intro to Data Analysis
##Project Instructions
The goal here was to demonstrate some basic Data analysis skills using the Python Pandas and Numpy library.

To showcase this, the wellknown **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle has been chosen. The main question that has been considered here was: **What factors made people more likely to survive**?

The correlation of the survival rate with each independent variable was studied, and visualizations were made to help the analyze. For a few unexpected results, additional Data manipulation was done to try to get some clues about possible explanations.

No machine learning algorythm has been used here. The point was not to recreate the Kaggle tutorial scripts, but to illustrate the first steps when confronted to a new (clean) dataset. 



##Background Dataset Information (from the Kaggle website)

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
