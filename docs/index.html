<h2>P6 - Make Effective Data Visualization</h2>

<div>
  <p><b>Objective: Create a polished data visualization that tells a story, allowing a reader to explore trends or patterns.</b></p>
  <p>I choose to use the monthly TGV train line regularity statistics from the French railway company (SNCF) with a "martini-glass" map visualization. The main message that should be communicated is that disturbances related to weather events or strikes tend to have the strongest impact on train regularity.</p>
  <p>The visualization is implemented in an html page, using the D3.js library and geojson data for drawing the map of France.</p>
