# P6 - Make Effective Data Visualization


## Motivation

This work is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanoprogram. This is the final project for the Data Visualization course. The goal of this project is to use the D3.js library to design a "martini-glass' visualization from a chosen dataset. In my case, I choose to use the monthly TGV train line regularity statistics from the French railway company (SNCF).


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project has been extracted from the open data portal from the French railway company (SNCF). It consists in monthly statistics about the main high-speed train lines (TGV). More precisely, it details for each entry (1 entry per train line per month):
- Train line start station
- Train line end station
- Number of programmed trains
- Number of trains having traveled
- Number of trains canceled
- Number of trains delayed
- The associated regularity (percentage of trains arrived on time)

Once cleaned from NaN values, the data set contains 2898 entries.

## Instructions for running

Python version

D3.js version


# PROJECT UNDER WORK
To be done:
- Improve train line paths
- Work on the markup file


## Summary


## Limitations and potentials
- Data set does not seem to be complete. Some TGV lines seems to be missing (Lyon Part Dieu - Mulhouse ?)
- The train line paths based on the TGV railway map (http://www.sncf.com/fr/trains/tgv/reseau). In order to focus my effort on the D3.js coding, I deliberately chose to simplify these paths.
